REVIEWS
This is a great camera for beginners. The auto mode produces images and various opportunity to play around with the manual mode.
"Upon purchase, received damage and use the lens and didn't match the description of the listing."
Camera works amazing. It's nice and compact and easy to carry around. The zoom on this camera is out of this world. It's awesome especially for the price. Also it has Wi-Fi built in so when you take a picture you can upload it to your smartphone.
"I'm calling you because I want information on how I can return this item. The pictures it takes are very fuzzy for a high end camera. Also, the autofocus feature doesn't work properly. Finally, the pictures seem overexposed and the stabilizer leaves much to be desired."
This camera is out of this world I had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. The photos are never blurry even when I'm taking pictures of my dog running around. I wouldn't trust any other brand after this.
 I'm not happy with the battery life of this camera. I charge it overnight at and only last an hour. That's not all the quality of pictures are better on my iPhone than this camera. I paid good money for this camera and feel I got ripped off.
"Amazing product, I do not understand why it didn't get this years ago. It never smelled it always clean. It's so easy to use, easy to change. Life changer."
Product doesn't work well. The lead can easily knocked and had a sensor desktop. It's from working when it does barely ever work. Alice monitored or feel times a day.
I take this camera everywhere with me. It produces fantastic photo quality and performs well even in low lighting conditions.
I've been having all sorts of problems with the lens fogging up and the camera just all of the sudden shutting off mid use. It's been very frustrated.
